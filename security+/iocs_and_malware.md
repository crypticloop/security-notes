# IOCs and Malware

## IOCs
> Indications/signs that unauthorised activity has compromised a system

### Usefulness
* Breadcrumbs for incident responders
* Lists of IOCs for attack are not absolute
    * Some may not appear during attack
    * Some may appear as false positives in normal operation
* In order to identify IOCs, need to know **baseline network activity**

### Example IOCs
| IOC | What this indicates |
| --- | --- |
| Unusual outbound traffic | Data exfiltration |
| Anomalies in priviledged accounts | More highly privileged activities taking place |
| Geo anomalies | Access by unauthorised actors |
| Account login red flags | General misuse of accounts |
| Increased db reads | Sensitive data read in volume |
| Increase HTML response size | Endpoints exploited to return sensitive data |
| High request volume | Automated access or attempt at request flooding |
| Mismatched port-app traffic | Exfiltration attempts |
| Suspicious registry/system file changes | Persistence |
| Unusual DNS requests | Malware masking communication with C2  |
|  Unexpected patching | Adversary patches but includes their persistence to prevent legitimate patch locking them out |
| Mobile device profile changes | Persistence on device |
| Data in wrong place | Exfiltration in progress |
| Non-human web traffic | Automated processes performing malicious behaviour |
| Degraded performance | DDoS |

### IOC sharing frameworks
#### OpenIOC
| More info | | More info | https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/walkthrough |
* Standard format to describe artifacts found in investigation
* Objects can be created in Vendor editor IOCe
* Written in XML

#### STIX/TAXII/CybOx
| More info | https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/walkthrough |

* STIX is language and serialisation format to exchange CTI
* TAXII is application protocol to support transfer of STIX over network
* TAXII server can be pub-sub or REST API service for STIX-formatted intelligence
* Written in Python
