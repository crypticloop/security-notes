# Threat Actors: Types and Attributes

## Exam Requirements
* Understand types of threat actors
* Understand attributes of threat actors
* Understand use of OSINT

## Types of Threat Actors
### Script Kiddies
* Enough technical knowledge to run scripts
* Not capable of developing their own scripts/discovering vulnerabilities
* Tend to not have specific targets
* Responsible for ~85% of all attacks

### Hacktivists
* Attackers (sometimes working together) for collectivist goal
* Technically capabale
    * Can write their own scripts to exploit vulnerabilities
* Responsible for ~8-12% of attacks

### Organised Crime
* Mainly differentiated by wealth of resources
* Groups of attackers hacking with criminal intent
    * Usually financially motivated
* Invest some earnings back into resources for hacking
    * Hacking tools
    * Sponsoring/employing lone hackers/rogue employees

### Nation States
* Elite level skills
* Tend to be those who discover and exploit new vulnerabilities
* Government sanctioned or employed attackers
* Attacks often devastating in scale or impact
    * Attacks often against other states

### APTs
* Threat actors looking to embed in networks and remain there
* Place value on being in the network for a long time
    * Want to see not only current information
    * But what information may appear on the network in the future

### Insiders
* Attackers with legitimate access to the network
    * Along with in-depth knowledge about how the network works
* Can be an accidental insider i.e. not all 'attacks' by insiders are malicious

### Competitors
* Corporate competitors acting to:
    * Disrupt target network for their own company's strategic advantage
    * Steal IP to use for competitive advantage

## Attributes
### Internal vs External
* Internal threat actors have distinct advantage over external actors
    * Due to their existing privileged access
    * Do not have to do any work to gain initial access to the network

### Sophistication
* Script kiddies are least sophisticated
* APTs are most sophisticated

### Resources/Funding
* Script kiddies have the least
* Organised crime/APTs have the most
    * Both 'employee' hackers

### Intent/Motivation
* Script kiddie: small financial, bored
* Hacktivists: Ideological
* Organised crime: Large financial
* Nation States/APTs: Political, military tactical

#### 3 Motivations of APT
* Maintain persitent presence on target system
* Go undetected
* Steal valuable information from target system

## Use of OSINT
* OSINT refers to intelligence gathered from public sources
* Data can come from:
    * News sites
    * Blogs
    * Twitter
    * Government reports

### Why use OSINT
* Free
* Fast
* Attackers have access to it to, would be a strategic disadvantage to not use it
* Helps inform focusing of resources

### OSINT Providers
#### Paid
* Types of groups which sell OSINT reports:
    * Information Sharing and Analysis Organisations (ISAO)
    * Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISAC)
* Reports are detailed and compiled by experts
* But cost money, and are often slow to be released

#### Free
* Infraguard (FBI)
    * Often issued late
* **Issues with both paid and free OSINT providers gives motivation for businesses to do their own OSINT**
    * And create community to share this information
