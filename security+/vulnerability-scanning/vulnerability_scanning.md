# Vulnerability Scanning

## Exam Requirements
* Need to be able to identify, understand and explain concepts of vulnerability scanning

## Definition
* Process of examining system for security weaknesses
* Prior to an attacker finding these
* So that vulnerabilities can be addressed

### Differences from Pen Testing
* Done in house
    * Not outsourced
* Only find the vulnerability, do no assesment of impact
    * Entire system (defence in depth) tested in pen testing

## Uses
* Identify vulnerabilities
* Identify missing security controls
    * I.e. missing alerts
* Identify common misconfiguration
    * Which could be exploited by attackers

## Vulnerability methods

### Intrusive vs. Non Intrusive
* Intrustive - changes something on the system
    * Could break application being scanned
* Non-intrusive - tries to not alter target in any way
* Comparisson similar to active  vs. passive pen testing

### Credentialed vs Non Credentialed
* Non-credentialed - only scanning for vulnerabilities exposed outwardly by the network
    * Quick
    * But lacks depth
* Credentialed - deeper scan with more detailed results
    * Application/OS level results which can be tailored
    * But requires credential management for the scanning processes
    * Also slow and computationally expensive

## Response to Vulnerability Scan Results
* Before results are collected, should make a **plan of action**
    * Fits into wider **vulnerability management program**
* When writing this, ask following questions:
    * What measures are taken to respond to vulnerabilities
    * What additional controls can be added

### False Positives
* System element incorrectly identified as vulnerability
* E.g. scan identifying security weakness in app after it has been uninstalled
    * Can be triggered by some old application files left on machine

### False Negatives
* Vulnerability scan fails to identify vulnerability
